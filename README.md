# VISD Badges

VISD Badges is a way for teachers and educators to improve their professional development in technological areas.

Users submit entries of their work to show they have completed a challenge. The challenges are grouped into different skillsets. When a user completes enough challenges in a skillset, that user earns a badge. We can see the badges a user has earned on that user's portfolio.
